# notes.md
Mobile application for notes with the ability to sync with the git repository

# Motivation
I've been using the MI Notes application for a long time, and I ran into a problem:
- there is no easy way to export all notes wherever you want.

I'm passionate about development, I have a lot of experience with React,
and I want to try React Native on some pet projects that might be interesting and useful to me.

I would like to be able to easily write notes and sync them with my GitHub repositories.

And also vice versa.
I would like to read other people's MD files from other repositories.

I think this is an interesting case.

# Main Goal
The main goal is UX. It is not at all necessary to create a full-fledged Markdown editor.
The main thing is ease of use on the phone. As an example, I would take the original MI Notes.
