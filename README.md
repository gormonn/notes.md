Mobile application for notes with the ability to sync with the git repository

# Motivation
I've been using the MI Notes application for a long time, and I ran into a problem:
- there is no easy way to export all notes wherever you want.

I'm passionate about development, I have a lot of experience with React, and I want to try React Native on some pet project that might be interesting and useful to me.

I would like to be able to easily write notes and sync them with my GitHub repositories.

And also vice versa.
I would like to read other people's MD files from other repositories.

I think this is an interesting case.
